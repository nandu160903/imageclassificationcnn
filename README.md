CIFAR-10 Image Classification with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
This project demonstrates the implementation and training of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the well-known CIFAR-10 dataset. The entire pipeline, from data loading and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and visualization, is included in the Project_Python.ipynb notebook.

Description
The goal of this project is to build a robust image classifier for the 10 different classes in the CIFAR-10 dataset. The notebook leverages the TensorFlow and Keras libraries to construct, train, and evaluate the CNN model. Techniques like data augmentation, batch normalization, and dropout are employed to improve the model's performance and prevent overfitting.

Dataset
The project uses the CIFAR-10 dataset, which is a standard benchmark for image classification tasks. It consists of:

60,000 total 32x32 color images.

10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class.

A training set of 50,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images.

The 10 classes are:
airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck.
